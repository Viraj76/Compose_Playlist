            ðŸš€ Composable function working ?
            ðŸš€ Recomposition ?
            ðŸš€ Important points -:
                ðŸ”¥ Composable functions can execute in any order.
                ðŸ”¥ Composable functions can execute in parallel.
                ðŸ”¥ Recomposition skips as many composable functions and
                   lambdas as possible.  (example in next video)
                ðŸ”¥ Recomposition is optimistic and may be canceled.
                ðŸ”¥ A composable function might be run quite frequently,
                   as often as every frame of an animation.
